                    Berean Bible Church [HALLELUJAH WORSHIP CENTER-MOMBASA] was founded with a heart for deep Biblical study and global mission. Like the noble
                    Bereans mentioned in Acts 17:11, we are committed to examining the Scriptures daily to see if what we hear
                    aligns with God's Word. Our church has grown from a small Bible study group into a thriving community
                    dedicated to Prayer, Word, and Mission.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                    Our name "Berean" reflects our commitment to being people of the Word - studying Scripture with eager
                    hearts and noble minds. We believe that through faithful study of God's Word, fervent prayer, and active
                    mission work, we can impact our community and the world for Christ.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    Today, Berean Bible Church continues to be a place where people can dive deep into Scripture, grow in
                    prayer, and participate in God's mission to reach the world with the Gospel. We welcome all who desire to
                    grow in their knowledge of God's Word and their relationship with Jesus Christ.
