                <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                    Berean Bible Church was founded with a heart for deep Biblical study and global mission. Like the noble
                    Bereans mentioned in Acts 17:11, we are committed to examining the Scriptures daily to see if what we hear
                    aligns with God's Word. Our church has grown from a small Bible study group into a thriving community
                    dedicated to Prayer, Word, and Mission.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                    Our name "Berean" reflects our commitment to being people of the Word - studying Scripture with eager
                    hearts and noble minds. We believe that through faithful study of God's Word, fervent prayer, and active
                    mission work, we can impact our community and the world for Christ.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    Today, Berean Bible Church continues to be a place where people can dive deep into Scripture, grow in
                    prayer, and participate in God's mission to reach the world with the Gospel. We welcome all who desire to
                    grow in their knowledge of God's Word and their relationship with Jesus Christ.

                            We believe salvation is a gift from God to humanity. People can never make up for their sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God's offer of forgiveness can anyone be saved from sin's penalty.

                            We believe the church is the body of Christ, of which Jesus Christ is the head. The members are those who have trusted by faith in the finished work of Christ. The purpose of the church is to glorify God by loving Him and by making Him known to a lost world.
